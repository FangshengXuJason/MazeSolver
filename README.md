#### Instruction for use

##### Run main.java (src\main\java\mazes\main.java) to check out our maze finder 

##### Configure the GUI and play with it
1. Generate new maze: just don't chose "do not delete any edges" since it give you impossible maze to solve
2. Hit "find shortest path"
3. If there is a possible path -> our bot finds it
   If no path -> generate a new maze again -> step 1
  
  ps: you can try out different "base maze shape" ;)
